## Project Thesis

This analysis is driven by a simple but non-trivial question:

**What does pet adoption data reveal about which animals struggle to find homes — and why?**

Rather than treating adoption as a metric to optimise, this project treats it as a system to understand. I’m interested in how time, structure, and constraints shape outcomes, and in what the data suggests about who waits the longest and under what conditions.

The focus is not on identifying “top” or “bottom” performers, but on examining patterns of waiting, variation, and trade-offs. Distributions matter more than averages, and long-tail experiences are more informative than headline numbers.

Where patterns appear consistent, the analysis explores how stable they are over time. Where they break down, that instability is treated as signal rather than noise. Throughout, the emphasis is on interpreting what the system appears to reward or penalise — often unintentionally — rather than attributing outcomes to individual animals.

This project is intentionally exploratory. The goal is not to produce a definitive answer, but to surface questions that are grounded in data and respectful of its limitations. Any insights are framed as observations, not prescriptions.
